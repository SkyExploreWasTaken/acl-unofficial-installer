DO NOT COPY AND REDISTRIBUTE THE MATERIAL IN ANY MEDIUM OR FORMAT!
I tried to delete this map but it continues to change and evolve without
any input from me. What began as a tribute to a lost friend has consumed
my entire life. As this map grew beyond what I created, I suffered
paranoia and insomnia. It consumed me. Don't let it consume you as well.
Delete it. Do not credit me. Do not try and contact me. Do not attempt to
use the material for commercial purposes. Do not remix, transform, or
build upon the material. Above all, do not distribute this file, modified
or otherwise. I tried to keep it from the internet, but it found its way
online. It's still changing. It wants you to feel sad. Alone. Desperate.
Don't let it win. Don't play it.
